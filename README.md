## Introduction

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here you'll find a collection of my projects, and experiments in the world of software development specially in Front-end. Feel free to explore, contribute, and connect with me.

## About Me

I am a passionate software developer with experience in developing mobile and web aps with usage of React Native, React and of course JavaScrip. Sometimes I like to write some low level aps with usage of C/c++ and to develop some games with Unity. I really enjoy building full stack web and mobile aps as well as building some simple components which I can reuse in future projects. I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies to expand my knowledge and skills.
